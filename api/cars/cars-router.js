// DO YOUR MAGIC

// ### Write a Cars API

// - Write CR (of CRUD) for the `cars` resource, using the middleware and model functions described above wherever appropriate inside `api/cars/cars-router.js` :

//   - `[GET] /api/cars` returns an array of cars sorted by id (or an empty array if there aren't any).
//   - `[GET] /api/cars/:id` returns a car by the given id.
//   - `[POST] /api/cars` returns the created car.

// - Manually test your endpoints with a REST client like `Insomnia` or `Postman` to check they are working as expected.
// - Test your endpoints automatically by running `npm test`.
